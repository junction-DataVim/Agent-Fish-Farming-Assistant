    "# Fish Farming Assistant Agent Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The **Fish Farming Assistant** is an AI-powered agent designed to help manage and optimize aquaculture operations. It leverages a combination of database queries and advanced AI models (such as Groq ) to provide actionable insights, monitor pond health, analyze sensor data, and alert users to potential issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- **Sensor Data Analysis:** Query and analyze real-time and historical sensor readings (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc.).\n",
    "- **Pond Status Monitoring:** Track fish growth, survival rate, and health status for each pond.\n",
    "- **Alert Management:** Review and analyze alerts for critical events (e.g., disease outbreaks, low oxygen levels).\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Summaries:** Generate detailed summaries for any pond, including recent alerts and available sensors.\n",
    "- **AI-Powered Insights:** Use Groq or OpenAI models to answer complex questions, provide recommendations, and explain technical data in user-friendly terms.\n",
    "- **Fallback to Direct Analysis:** If no API key is set, the agent can still provide full database-driven analysis and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "1. **Setup:**\n",
    "   - Install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`).\n",
    "   - Ensure the fish farming database (`fish_farming_timeseries.db`) is available and populated.\n",
    "   - Set your Groq or OpenAI API key as an environment variable for AI-powered features.\n",
    "2. **Available Tools:**\n",
    "   - `sensor_tool`: Query sensor readings.\n",
    "   - `pond_tool`: Query pond status.\n",
    "   - `alert_tool`: Query alerts.\n",
    "   - `summary_tool`: Get pond summary.\n",
    "   - `list_tool`: List all available ponds.\n",
    "3. **Agent Capabilities:**\n",
    "   - Ask the agent questions about pond health, water quality, recent alerts, and receive actionable recommendations.\n",
    "   - Use the agent for both manual data analysis and AI-enhanced insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Questions\n",
    "- \"What is the current health status of TilapiaPond_001?\"\n",
    "- \"Show recent sensor readings for all ponds.\"\n",
    "- \"Are there any critical alerts in the last 24 hours?\"\n",
    "- \"Recommend actions to improve survival rate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- The agent is extensible: you can add new tools or connect to other AI models as needed.\n",
    "- If the AI API key is not set, the agent will automatically fall back to direct database analysis.\n",
